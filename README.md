## Summary ##
- One drawback of this design is the filter search section of the webpage.It is difficult to determine the data by just scrolling down the table. 
Ex: city name la Mesa is in CA,US. The user might not be known to the data present in the table before while searching. 
- A dropdown list with button must be added all filter tabs to make the filter Search more effictive and easy to access, which are displayed under all filter search tab. So that the user can select the data which is required.
